Project Proposal Feedback
Project: Stock Software
=========================

Proposal Document [3 points]:
-----------------------------
Nice work here.  You have described your application very well, and reading
through the first paragraph gives me a general sense of what your 'problem'
is and how you plan to solve it.  The comparison with existing applications
add context.  The features list is good to show what your plan is.

The justification section is also good, complete and to the point without
ONLY listing all the courses you took at LMU.  I like that you are treating
the project as a learning opportunity as well as a chance to use your
knowledge.

Proposal Presentation [2 points]:
---------------------------------
Your presentation was very good, met all the requirements as listed, and
provided enough detail so the audience saw interested without having so
much text that they couldn't read it all before the next slide appeared.
I enjoyed the presentation and you answered questions well.  Good audience
reception, too.

Summary:
--------
You don't have a copy of your proposal presentation in your repository, so
that costs you a point.  Put a copy in there and let me know, and you'll
get full credit.

Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.

4 out of 5 for a B on this deliverable.
