Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4071 Fall 2025
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
====================
This is a bare minimum in this section.  It would be better to have a 'real'
   diagram with labeled boxes and lines and arrows to show the system parts
   and how they interrelate.  Also, some sort of verbal description would
   be good.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
========================
The document lists tools, libraries, APIs, and data sources (e.g., FinBERT,
   Pandas, Alpaca, Binance, etc.).
However, it lacks explicit functional requirements written in a structured,
   testable format (e.g., “The system shall…”).
There is no clear description of what the system is supposed to do from a
   user or system perspective (e.g., trade execution, signal generation,
   portfolio management).

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
=========================
No performance metrics are defined in the document.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
=========================
Lists tools and infrastructure, but lacks structure and completeness.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:

   Preliminary Schedule                1/2
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   2/10 = 2% which is not the best for this deliverable.

There is really nothing here to work with.  You need to re-do this entire
   document from scratch.  Look at the example document for TempConvApp
   and the directions on the SRS web page on the course web site to find
   out what is expected.
Your preliminary schedule was supposed to be a Gantt or PERT chart.  You've
   simply listed the deliverables with the weeks you're planning.  Make an
   actual schedule chart that shows the durations and linkages with your
   development.  Then include this in your SDP.

Nice work on this deliverable!  Make the changes indicated by the end of the
semester for full credit on the document.
