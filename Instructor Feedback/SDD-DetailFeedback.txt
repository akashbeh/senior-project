DETAILED CSC AND CSU DESCRIPTIONS:
   Not done

DETAILED CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      Each class includes:
         Purpose
         Fields/internal state
         Methods with explanations
         Inputs/outputs
         Interactions with other CSUs
         Mapping to SRS requirements
      Logical grouping by CSC (Data Collection, Sentiment Analysis, Signal
         Generation, Modeling, Recommendations, Insider Data, Reporting).
      Clear alignment with functional requirements (e.g., SRS 1.3.2–1.3.6).
      Includes practical implementation details (e.g., Python modules,
         libraries like pysentimiento, yfinance).
   Suggestions:
      Add visibility and relationships
         (public/private, inheritance, composition).
      Include state diagrams or lifecycle notes for dynamic components
         (e.g., DailySignalGenerator).
      Provide algorithm pseudo-code for complex methods
         (e.g., calculate_svc(), engineer_price_features()).
      Document error handling strategies (e.g., API failures, missing data).
      Explicitly link each class to requirement IDs in a traceability table.

DETAILED INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      Interfaces between CSUs are clearly listed
         (e.g., CommentScraper -> SentimentAnalyzer,
         DailySignalGenerator -> Classifiers).
      Specifies data formats (CSV) and fields for each interface.
      Covers integration points for insider data and modeling pipeline.
   Suggestions:
      Provide formal interface tables with:
         Method signatures
         Input/output types
         Error conditions
      Include sequence diagrams for critical flows
         (e.g., social media -> sentiment -> signal -> model -> strategy).
      Document data transfer protocols
         (e.g., synchronous vs asynchronous, file naming conventions).

DETAILED DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      Defines key structures:
         Social Media Record
         Sentiment Structure
         Price Structure
         SVC Feature Structure
         ML Feature Vector
         Strategy Output
      Includes field names and descriptions.
   Suggestions:
      Add data types for all fields (some are missing).
      Include validation rules (e.g., ticker format, sentiment score range).
      Provide serialization examples (JSON or CSV samples).
      Document relationships and cardinality
         (e.g., one ticker -> many sentiment records).

DETAILED DESIGN DIAGRAMS:
   Strengths
      Diagrams are consistent with the SDD’s CSC decomposition and reflect
         the end-to-end pipeline from data collection through reporting.
      They highlight key responsibilities that match your class methods
         and interface narratives.
      The deployment context diagram adds clarity on environment, boundaries,
         and artifacts—valuable for both Agile onboarding and
         Waterfall documentation.
   Suggestions
      Traceability: Add CSU names/methods to boxes/arrows to tie diagrams
         directly to 6.3.1 entries.
      Interface Formality: Label arrows with formats/fields; add
         error-handling annotations and protocols to meet 6.3.2 expectations.
      Data Schemas: Include field/type tables (mini legends) near flows;
         add validation rules in callouts for 6.3.3 completeness.
      Model Completeness: Include RandomForest path and Insider Data CSC
         processing blocks explicitly.
      Behavioral Diagrams: Add a sequence diagram with lifelines/method
         calls or enhance Diagram 3 with swimlanes; consider a state
         diagram for model lifecycle or signal generation.
      Operational Details: Show retry/backoff, scheduling,
         file naming/versioning, and security considerations
         (API key handling) in the deployment diagram.

I don't see a detailed section in your SDD or a separate document either.
I can't evaluate what isn't there....

Overall Impression
Your document is very strong for Agile and partially compliant with Waterfall
   standards.  It includes detailed class descriptions, interface
   specifications, data structures, and a class diagram.  However, some
   formal elements required for Waterfall completeness - such as traceability
   matrices, algorithm pseudo-code, and explicit error handling—are missing.
