=======================================

INTRODUCTION SECTION:
   System objectives section
   Hardware, software, and human interfaces section
      This section is fine.

ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN SECTION:
   Strengths
      Clear modular architecture: The system is organized into five layers
         (Data Collection, Analysis, Cross-Referencing, Recommendation,
         Reporting), which promotes scalability and maintainability.
      Purpose-driven separation: Each layer has a distinct responsibility,
         reducing coupling and improving clarity.
      Alignment with objectives: The architecture supports the main goals
         (data scraping, sentiment analysis, correlation, reporting).
   Suggestions
      Add rationale for architectural style: Explicitly state whether this
         design follows a layered architecture pattern and why it was chosen
         (e.g., for separation of concerns, testability).
      Include non-functional considerations: Briefly address performance,
         security, and extensibility (e.g., handling large datasets, API
         rate limits).
      Clarify data flow between layers: While the layers are listed, a short
         description of how data transitions between them would improve
         completeness.

   Major softwre components section
      Strengths
         Comprehensive component list: Covers all major subsystems (Data
            Collection, Sentiment Analysis, Cross-Referencing,
            Recommendation Engine, Report Generation).
         Inputs and outputs specified: Each component includes what it
            consumes and produces, which is excellent for traceability.
         Responsibilities clearly defined: Each component’s role is
            described in functional terms.
      Suggestions
         Add mapping to functional requirements: Include explicit references
            to SRS requirements (e.g., FR 5.2.x) for compliance.
         Clarify component boundaries: For example, does the Data Collection
            component handle error recovery or is that delegated elsewhere?
         Include scalability notes: Indicate how components will handle
            future phases (e.g., political trade data integration).

   Major software interactions section
      Strengths
         Sequential data flow described:
            The pipeline from Reddit API -> Data Collection -> Sentiment
               Analysis -> Cross-Referencing -> Recommendation -> Reporting
               is clear.
         External interactions noted: Mentions Reddit API and stock market
            APIs, which is important for integration.
      Suggestions
         Add interaction diagrams: A sequence diagram or flowchart would
            make this section stronger.
         Clarify error handling and edge cases: For example, what happens
            if Reddit API fails or returns incomplete data?
         Include data exchange details: Specify formats (e.g., JSON, CSV)
            and protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) for external interactions.

   Architectural design diagrams section
      Strengths
         Diagram placeholder included: Indicates awareness of the need for
            visual representation.
      Suggestions
         Provide actual diagrams: Include:
            Component diagram showing relationships between modules.
            Data flow diagram illustrating how data moves through layers.
            Add labels and legends: Ensure diagrams clearly indicate
               components, interactions, and data flow directions.
         Verify alignment with text: Diagrams should match the descriptions
            in 6.2 and 6.2.2.

Overall Completeness Assessment
   The document is strong at the architectural level but needs enhancements
   for full compliance with SDD standards. It:
      Defines major components and their responsibilities.
      Explains interactions and includes a placeholder for diagrams.
      Uses a layered architecture that supports modularity.
   However, it lacks explicit requirement mapping, detailed rationale for
      design choices, and actual diagrams, which are essential for completeness.
