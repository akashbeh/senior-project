Homework Assignment #1
CMSI 4071 Fall 2025
======================

SUMMARY:
The essay provides a detailed and accurate summary of William Langewiesche’s
article. It captures the key events of the ValuJet 592 crash and the systemic
failures that led to the disaster.

The essay clearly explains the distinctions between procedural, engineered,
and system accidents, emphasizing that the ValuJet crash was a system
accident. It also includes the role of the NTSB investigation, the mishandling
of oxygen generators, and the broader implications of complex systems.

The essay references specific examples from the article, including the role
of SabreTech, the FAA's oversight failures, and the concept of "normal
accidents" from Charles Perrow.

The writing is well-organized and flows logically. The explanation of
technical and organizational failures is clear and accessible.

The essay goes beyond summarizing by engaging with the article's broader
themes, such as the inevitability of accidents in complex systems and the
dangers of distributed responsibility.

CRITICAL THINKING:
The essay draws strong and meaningful parallels between the ValuJet disaster
and software engineering, particularly in the context of complexity,
distributed responsibility, and systemic failure.

The discussion of "normalization of deviance" in software development is
particularly compelling. The essay effectively connects this concept to
common industry practices like skipping tests, ignoring bugs, and rushing
code.

The essay integrates key software engineering principles such as testing,
documentation, redundancy, peer review, and ethical responsibility. It also
discusses the trade-offs between complexity and manageability.

The proposed solutions ~ like failover systems, automated rollbacks, and
cross-training ~ are practical and grounded in real-world software
engineering practices.

The section is well-structured, with clear transitions and a logical
progression of ideas. The writing is articulate and professional.

Overall: The application to software engineering is insightful, relevant,
and well-developed, showing a mature understanding of both the article's
themes and their implications for software development.

Overall: The application to software engineering is insightful, relevant,
and well-developed, showing a mature understanding of both the article's
themes and their implications for software development.  It seems to be a
highly effective and thoughtful response to the assignment which
demonstrates a strong grasp of the source material and applies its lessons
to software engineering in a nuanced and practical way.

Strengths:
Deep understanding of system accidents and their relevance to engineering.
Excellent use of analogies and real-world parallels.
Clear articulation of ethical and technical responsibilities in software
   development.
Practical and well-reasoned recommendations for improving software
   reliability.

Suggestions for Improvement:
Minor grammatical refinements could enhance readability.
Including a brief real-world software failure case (e.g., Knight Capital,
   Ariane 5, or Boeing 737 MAX software issues) could further strengthen the
   application.
