Data refinement

Features:
"Trade direction": Insider trades net/volume over day, week, month, 3 months, 6 months
"Buyer change": (Over likewise periods) remaining value (remaining shares * price) / transaction (Reciprocal to prevent div by 0)

STEPS:

1. Manual refinement
	1. If transaction type != code: delete
	2. Delete transaction type
	3. Delete Description (all the same as code)
	4. Delete form, delete issuer, delete position, delete remarks. Do NOT delete insider or price
	5. Delete if shares or value == 0
	6. Delete before 2020
2. Merge.py: combines all 2020 data
3. Clean.py: builds features

4. ../svm_full.py:
- apply features to days in between
- merge with the incomplete "full_merged_data.csv"
